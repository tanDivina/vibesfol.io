## Finding the Right Project

### Start With Projects You Use
- Look at your package.json or requirements.txt

- `help wanted`
- `documentation`
- `easy`

### Project Health Indicators
Look for projects that are:
- **Actively maintained:** Recent commits and releases
- **Welcoming community:** Helpful maintainers and contributors

```

### 3. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
# or
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```
